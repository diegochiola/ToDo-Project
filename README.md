## Improvements
- Validations: 
 - Task Input Validation: Ensure that all task inputs are properly validated to prevent empty or invalid data submissions. 
 
 - Profile Input Validation: Strengthen the validation for profile fields to ensure that inputs like email, username, and website follow appropriate formats and are not left blank.
 
- User Alert Messages:
 - Error Notifications: Implement user-friendly error messages that provide clear feedback when actions such as creating a profile or adding a task fail.

- Task Management :

 - Task Grouping by Status: Introduce the ability to group tasks by their status (e.g., "To do", "In progress", "Done") in the UI. This will help users to better organize and visualize their tasks based on their current state.
 
- Responsive Design: 
 - Further improve the responsiveness of the app to ensure it works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
